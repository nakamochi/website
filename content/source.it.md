title: "design and code sources"
---

All the designs and software source code are located on our self-hosted
git repositories at [git.qcode.ch/nakamochi/](https://git.qcode.ch/nakamochi/).
We also mirror them on GitHub at [github.com/nakamochi/](https://github.com/nakamochi/)
for redundancy, broader awareness and to ease contributions.

Our self-hosted git repositories accept issues and code changes only from
existing accounts, and creating new accounts feature is disabled: we'd like
to avoid potential abuse. Nonetheless, we will happily take in any suggestions
on the GitHub mirrors.

The following are the main repositories where the development is done.

## NDG

Nakamochi daemon and GUI, the main software part. It is composed of two layers:
a background daemon and a touch-capable GUI interface.
