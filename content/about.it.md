We as [qeles AG] have many years of experience in manufacturing PCBs and
hardware assembly. We want to use this knowledge to start a bottom up
approach to a concept that has mainly moved in the software world. Designing
and manufacturing a secure device, starting at the hardware level, allows
us to keep a large part of the supply chain and the manufacturing as secure
as possible in an open source device.

Knowing the manufacturing processes, bringing a portfolio of products to the
market to cater for all freedom and contribution levels and assuring security,
we believe we can offer a product for many participants.

We value privacy and security. We will use our knowledge in this field to help
people in achieving complete financial sovereignty and independence.
